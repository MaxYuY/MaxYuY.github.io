            <p class="text3">The mountains and coast of Western Maui and Northwestern Maui are some of the most remote and overlooked 
                parts of the island. So much cool hiking can be found here, making for the perfect excursion from the typical 
                beach life of the other parts of the island. 
            </p>

            <p class="text3">The main hike I did here was the roughly 4 mile roundtrip Waihe'e Ridge Trail, 
                a stunning hike that is 100% worth it. Not only do you get views of the emerald green West Maui mountain range 
                itself, the best scenery is that of the town of Kahului and the massive Haleakala Volcano rising above it, 
                a spectacular view that's alone worth the hike up.

            <p class="text3">Besides Waihe'e Ridge, West Maui is also home to some coastal wonders, such as the Nakalele Blowhole (top row)
                and the Olivine Pools (bottom row), both accessible via a short hike. These two destinations make for a perfect
                and relatively off-the-beaten-path adventure in one of the most scenic and underrated parts of this beautiful island paradise.
