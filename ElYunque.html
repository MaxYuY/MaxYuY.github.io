            <p class="text3">El Yunque National Forest is one of the most popular places to visit in Puerto Rico, and for 
                good reason. The park is home to pristine rainforests and plenty of great views of the main island 
                of Puerto Rico accessible by trail, making for a great place for adventure on the island. 
            </p>

            <p class="text3">On my visit to El Yunque, I did the Torre Britton Trail after passing by the Catarata Coca
                Waterfall (top left), and it certainly was a great choice. The hike brought us past and up the brilliant 
                nearby peaks and to this stunning overlook of the island, with views of Eastern Puerto rico (bottom left)
                as well as Luquillo town (bottom center, bottom right). With plenty of other great hikes, waterfalls, 
                and stunning views of the island, El Yunque in general is a must-visit attraction 
                here in Puerto Rico.
