            <p class="text3">The peculiar karst landscapes of Yunnan's Stone Forest are so cool. The park is 
                located just an hour from the bustling city of Kunming, making it one of the most accessible 
                natural wonders in China and certainly one of the highlights of the city.

            <p class="text3">The formations of Stone Forest are so diverse, with plenty of great hiking and 
                viewpoints to offer. My favorite view has to be the top viewpoint overlooking the entire Stone Forest, 
                making the whole landscape look otherworldly. Other cool stone/karst formations can be found across the forest,
                and another highlight had to be the massive rocks scattered around the emerald green landscape at the 
                bottom of Stone Forest, certainly making the park a magical and otherworldly place to visit and appreciate.
