            <p class="text3"> The capital city of Puerto Rico is one of the most scenic cities in the world, home to 
                extremely scenic beaches and a stunning downtown. The city and its surroundings are probably the most visited and most iconic
                part in all of Puerto Rico.

            <p class="text3">The beaches near San Juan are literally paradise, with the Mar Chiquita Beach 
                less than an hour drive from San Juan being my favorite. Even without getting wet, the 
                beach is simply gorgeous. Hiking on the rocky sides of the beach was the highlight of my 
                experience here as watching the massive waves crash into the golden beach was surreal.

            <p class="text3">Downtown San Juan or Old San Juan is one of the most scenically wonderful downtowns of any city. 
                The area is home to the San Juan National Historic Site centered around the Castillo San Felipe del Morro, 
                bringing incredible seaside, ancient fort, and city views, especially of the colorful La Perla neighborhood. 
                The fort area is also home to some wild/feral cats (bottom row), which were so cute and makes the gorgeous seaside city views 
                even more enjoyable.
