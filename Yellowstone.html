            <p class="text3">Yellowstone is by far my favorite National Park not just in the United States, but 
                in the entire world. With plenty of awesome scenery and the best wildlife opportunities
                of any U.S. National Park, there is so much to see and do here and you certainly won't get 
                bored on your visit.
            </p>

            <p class="text3">Probably the most iconic Yellowstone attraction has to be its geothermal features. 
                The Old Faithful Geyser Basin is a must visit, centered around the iconic Old Faithful Geyser.
                On my visit, I got to witness huge eruptions of both an Old Faithful and the nearby Grand Geyser (left). Nearby, the Grand Prismatic Spring (center) is equally stunning, one of the most 
                colorful things I've ever seen. Along with hot springs at Mammoth (right), Norris, and West Thumb on the 
                shores of the Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone's geothermal areas are epic to see
                up close and personal.

            <p class="text3">The Yellowstone River and Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is another beautiful place
                to visit in the park. The river flows north from the shores of Yellowstone Lake, down past the 
                stunning Hayden Valley before carving into the Yellowstone Grand Canyon, which consists of 
                2 picturesque waterfalls that can easily be accessed from the Canyon Village. There are trails and viewpoints on both
                the North and South Rim of the canyon, which bring you some awesome views of the waterfalls as you 
                are also surrounded by adorable chipmunks at the gorgeous overlooks. Further downstream
                from the canyon are even more amazing views of the river as it flows towards the Tower Roosevelt 
                area near Lamar Valley. In my opinion, the canyon views and the Yellowstone River are just
                as impressive as the geothermal features, certainly a must visit.

            <p class="text3">While the geothermal features and the Yellowstone Grand Canyon are both fantastic
                in their own right, by far my favorite attraction of Yellowstone National Park is its wildlife.
                My favorite creature has to be Bears though, with both black bears, cinnamon bears (color morph of the black bear),
                and grizzly bears calling the park home. Some of all-time favorite bear sightings occured in
                Yellowstone, including my favorite wildlife sighting to this day, a mother grizzly 
                and her adorable tiny cub (Entire top row) hanging out in the meadows near Yellowstone Lake,
                which was magical to watch in person. Other fantastic bear sightings included a Grizzly Bear (Bottom Left)
                foraging on the roadside of Hayden Valley, a beautiful Cinnamon Bear (Bottom Center) at Petrified Tree in the 
                northern part of the park, and countless black bears (Bottom Right) all over the park, especially in both Hayden Valley and
                Lamar Valley. On my week-long visit, I got to see over 40 bears total, one of the greatest wildlife 
                experiences I've ever had and certainly the highlight of my Yellowstone trip.

            <p class="text3">There are also many Herbivorous animals that can also be found in the wilds of 
                Yellowstone. The most famous of which, and the symbol of the NPS, are Bison (First two), which can be 
                found all over the park, but especially in Lamar and Hayden Valleys where there are huge herds of them roaming in the endless grasslands. 
                Just as abundant are Elk (3rd), which I found many near Mammoth Hot Springs and along Yellowstone Lake.
                My favorite herbivore was the Moose (4th), the largest deer species in the world, as I got to witness a breathtaking mother
                moose and her adorable calf up close on the roadside in the northern part of the park. Another unique creature are Pronghorn (5th and 6th), who's closest relative
                is actually the giraffe, and are also the fastest land mammal in the Americas. They are such cool and unique animals and are abundant across the
                open fields of Lamar Valley, just like the Ground Squirrels (7th and 8th) of the valley's Trout Lake trail, some of the smallest and cutest animals I got to see in the 
                park. Ultimately, the variety of herbivores here is amazing and certainly makes Yellowstone a mecca for wildlife.

            <p class="text3">Yellowstone is home to a wide range of land carnivores as well. This includes the beautiful Red Fox (1st),
                which I had the privilege to see in Lamar Valley on the roadside. I also found a ton of Coyotes (2nd) in the park, 
                in places like Lamar and Hayden Valleys as well as near Mt. Washburn and on the shores of Yellowstone Lake. 
                On my visit, I even spotted a family of coyote pups and their dens in Lamar Valley from a distance as well as 
                multiple Coyotes running and foraging on the side of the road. The most famous carnivore in Yellowstone
                are Gray Wolves (3rd), which have been reintroduced to the wild and since thriving in the park in 1995. Now, in places like
                Lamar Valley and Hayden Valley (where I saw them), you have a good chance of seeing a herd of wolves 
                hanging out together, especially at dawn and dusk. Badgers (4th) are also common in 
                Yellowstone, and I got so lucky to see a entire family of them crossing the road at the entrance of
                Lamar Valley! Overall, Yellowstone's carnivores are so cool in my opinion and was certainly a joy to watch in this beautiful park.

            <p class="text3">Yellowstone is also home to a wide range of bird species. Some of the birding highlights
                include many Bald Eagles (Left), including one feasting on a Marmot it caught earlier on the 
                shores of Yellowstone Lake. Waterfowl like Canada Geese and Green Winged Teals (Center) are also 
                common, and I got to see a wide variety of them in Hayden Valley near the Yellowstone River. 
                Finally, Golden Eagles are abundant too, and I even got to see a family of Golden Eagles (Right) nesting
                in Lamar Valley, just above the coyote den mentioned earlier. With all the wildlife and gorgeous scenery found here in 
                Yellowstone, it is certainly a must-visit park if you love seeing animals in the wild and want to 
                have an unforgettable experience in one of the US's greatest natural wonders.
