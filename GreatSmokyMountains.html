            <p class="text3">Great Smoky Mountains National Park in both Tennessee and North Carolina is the most 
                visited national park in the U.S, and its no wonder why. From gorgeous mountain and valley views to 
                great wildlife opportunities, this park is one of my favorites and is certainly worth a visit.

            <p class="text3">The Smokies are home to some fantastic sightseeing opportunities. While there are 
                plenty of great places to visit here, my favorite has to be Cades Cove (Left), a beautiful emerald green valley 
                that's home to plenty of wildlife (see below). The Newfound Gap road (Center) and Clingmans Dome brings you to 
                some of the most scenic mountain views, which are sometimes covered in a gorgeous layer of fog ("Smoke"). 
                The waterfalls here are also really cool, like Abrams Falls (Right) in Cades Cove as well as Laurel Falls. 
                While certainly not as impressive as parks in the west, the Smokies is still a great place to go
                if you want to enjoy nature.

            <p class="text3">What the Smokies lack in top-notch scenery, they certainly make up for in wildlife, specifically, Black Bears. 
                This park is firmly in 2nd place in terms of bear sightings, only behind Yellowstone, and I saw over 
                20 of them over just a 3-day visit, with all of them occuring in Cades Cove on the Tennessee side. My favorite, by far, has to be a mother bear and her 4 Cubs (Top Row) hanging 
                out in the woods, which was simply adorable to watch from a distance. This is the most bear cubs I've ever seen, and 
                it was so cute to watch them climb up and down trees under the protection of their mother. Some other 
                notable bear sightings was a large bear crossing the road (Bottom Left) and another adorable bear (Bottom Center, bottom right) feasting on 
                berries and nuts up in a tree. With countless other notable bear encounters I had in the park and Cades Cove, 
                the Smokies certainly is one of the best parks for bears and you're almost guaranteed to find them
                if you come in dawn and dusk. Combining the bear haven of Cades Cove with the plenty of other sights in the 
                Smokies certainly makes it a must-visit park in my opinion.
