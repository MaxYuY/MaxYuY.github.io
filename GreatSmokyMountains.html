            <p class="text3">Great Smoky Mountains National Park in both Tennessee and North Carolina is the most 
                visited national park in the U.S, and its no wonder why. From gorgeous mountain and valley views to 
                great wildlife opportunities, this park is one of my favorites in the entire U.S. 
            </p>

            <p class="text3">The Smokies are home to some fantastic sightseeing opportunities. While there are 
                plenty of great places to visit here, my favorite has to be Cades Cove (Left), a extensive valley 
                that's home to plenty of wildlife (see below). The Newfound Gap road (Center) and Clingmans Dome brings you to 
                some of the most scenic mountain views, which are sometimes covered in a gorgeous layer of fog ("Smoke"). 
                The waterfalls here are also really cool, like Abrams Falls (Right) in Cades Cove as well as Laurel Falls. 
                While certainly not as impressive as parks in the west, the Great Smoky Mountains are still a great place to visit, 
                especially in the Eastern U.S.
                .

            <p class="text3">What the Smokies lack in top-notch scenery, they certainly make up for in wildlife, specifically, Black Bears. 
                This park is firmly in 2nd place in terms of bear watching opportunities, only behind Yellowstone. I saw over 
                20 of them over just a 3-day visit, with all of them occuring in Cades Cove on the Tennessee side. My favorite, by far, has to be a mother bear and her 4 Cubs (Top Row) hanging 
                out in the woods, which was simply adorable to watch from a distance. This is the most bear cubs I've ever seen, and 
                it was so cute to watch them climb up and down trees under the protection of their mother. Some other 
                notable bear sightings was a large bear crossing the road (Bottom Left) and another adorable bear (Bottom Center, bottom right) feasting on 
                berries and nuts up in a tree. With countless other notable bear encounters I had in the park and Cades Cove, 
                you're almost guaranteed to find them if you come during dawn and dusk. Combining the bear haven of Cades Cove with the plenty of other sights across the 
                Smokies and it's no question why it's one of the best and most visited national parks in the entire country.
