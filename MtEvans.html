            <p class="text3">Reaching up to over 4300 meters above sea level, the Mt. Evans Scenic Byway in Colorado to 
                its namesake mountain (or Mt. Blue Sky) is the highest paved road in the United States, and with 
                fantastic scenery and wildlife opportunities, is totally worth the drive up. 
            </p>

            <p class="text3">The hiking at the top of the mountain is absolutely stunning, bringing great views of 
                Summit Lake (Left, center) below as well as the other Front Range mountains (right) in the background. 
                Even without hiking though, there is endless gorgeous scenery at every point on the byway.

            <p class="text3">While the mountain and alpine views are certainly spectacular, the wildlife along the byway is 
                the highlight of the drive in my opinion. My favorite wildlife species has to be the Mountain Goats (entire top row), 
                as I saw multiple herds of Mountain Goats and their adorable lambs in various points along the drive. 
                Bighorn sheep (Bottom left images) are also abundant, especially around the Summit Lake area where they often roam 
                on or near the road. Adorable Marmots (Bottom right images) and pikas are also extremely common, especially
                on the trail up to the summit. With so many high quality animal sightings I had here, the Mt. Evans Scenic Byway 
                is a wildlife haven within the gorgeous mountains of the Colorado Front Range.
