            <p class="text3">Zion National Park in Utah is the crowl jewel of Utah, home to one of the most beautiful 
                canyons in the world. Located in the southwest part of the state, Zion is sort of unique among all canyons, as 
                you start at the bottom of the canyon and hike up to viewpoints instead of vice-versa. Plus, the canyon is 
                so colorful, rivaling even the Grand Canyon in scenery and natural beauty.
            </p>

        <div class = "container">
            
            <p class="text3">The park has two sections: The outer part of the canyon which is accessible by 
                car and the inner part of the canyon which is only accessible by shuttle bus. The outer part of 
                the canyon is beautiful, with hikes like the Pa'rus Trail (Left) leading to spectacular views 
                of the Watchman (Center). Another brilliant hike at the outer part of the canyon is the Canyon Overlook Trail (Right), 
                one of the most scenically beautiful viewpoints of the canyon below. The outer canyon is simply gorgeous and 
                gives you a great introduction to the scenery Zion has to offer.

        <div class = "container">
            
            <p class="text3">The Inner part of Zion canyon is absolutely stunning, with plenty of hikes and viewpoints to 
                treat yourself with. Both the Riverside Walk (Top Left, to the Narrows hike) and the Emerald Pools Trail (Top Right) 
                bring some of the best views of the canyon from the bottom. There are also plenty of hikes that bring you 
                higher up on the canyon wall, including my favorite trail I did in Zion, the trail to Scout Lookout (Bottom row) and Angels Landing, 
                as you will be in awe of the canyon scenery in all directions. With all the amazing trail and lookouts, Zion 
                takes the crown for my favorite national park for hiking, as well as containing some of the most beautiful views in all of the US.

            <p class="text3">With its top-notch landscapes, there are some cool wildlife species that also call the park home. 
                This includes Mule Deer (Left), which I saw near the visitor center, as well as tons of adorable Ground Squirrels (Center and Right), 
                which I saw many of on the Riverside Walk. With other species in the park like Wild Turkeys, Bighorn sheep, and chipmunks, 
                Zion has to be the best national park in Utah for wildlife and is certainly nice to see in such stunning desert scenery.
