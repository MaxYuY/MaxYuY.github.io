            <p class="text3">Corcovado National Park is located on the Osa Peninsula in the Southwestern 
                part of Costa Rica, and is one of my favorite national parks in the entire world. The coast 
                is absolutely beautiful, not to mention the hugely abundant wildlife that can be found that 
                makes the park one of the most biodiverse places on Earth that also makes this the crown 
                jewel of Costa Rica in my opinion.

            <p class="text3">The boat ride to the Sirena area of Corcovado is incredibly scenic, with plenty 
                of stunning views of the coastal rainforest behind gorgeous gold and black sand beaches. Even 
                though the ride to the park takes 1.5-2 hours, the coastal Costa Rican scenery here is an attraction in itself.

            <p class="text3">While the coastal rainforest scenery is stunning, the wildlife of the park is the 
                highlight of the park. So many animals call this place home, including the Tapir, the largest land mammal 
                in Latin America and my favorite in the park. My best wildlife encounter was this huge Tapir (Top left, top center)
                relaxing in a mudhole near the trail, which was both adorable and fascinating to see in person. I also 
                got to see 2 tapirs swimming in the Sirena river (top right), an equally beautiful sight and something I've never seen before. 
                Aside from Tapirs, the next most abundant creature were Coatis (bottom row), which were adorable and literally everywhere 
                on the forest floor and even in the trees. These two animals alone would already make Corcovado a special place 
                and you are almost guaranteed to see them on your visit here.

            <p class="text3">Other cool wildlife I saw in Corcovado included all 4 Costa Rican monkey species, 
                which my favorite in this park was Spider Monkeys (Top row), which were so abundant that I got to 
                see a mother and her baby in the trees as well as a whole troop of them near the beach. The park 
                is the only place where I got to see all 4 of the species too, with Squirrel, Capuchin, and howler monkeys 
                all being present in the park. I also saw a few Sloths (Bottom center) and Agoutis (bottom right) in the 
                Corcovado rainforests, as well as probably one of the rare wildlife moments I've ever had, which was two 
                anteaters (bottom left) having an all-out brawl on the side of the park trail, one of the most epic things I've ever witnessed. 
                The sheer abundance of land mammals is crazy and you're almost guaranteed to see most of the wildlife I got 
                to encounter.

            <p class="text3">Along with the huge amount of rainforest mammals, tons of birds, like the beautiful 
                Scarlet Macaws (Left) and toucans, as well as lizards (center) and iguanas (right). With so much 
                diverse wildlife in this beautiful rainforest, Corcovado is absolutely worth going out of your way 
                to visit and by far the best place I've visited in Costa Rica.
