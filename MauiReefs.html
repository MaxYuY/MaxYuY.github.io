                itself to exploring the underwater world and its incredible marine life off the shores the beautiful island.

            <p class="text3">Snorkeling has to be my favorite thing I did on the island, which my favorite beaches 
                included Honokeana Bay (left), Kapalua Bay (center), Coral Gardens (right) which is only accessible by tour,
                Honolua Bay, and Kahekeli Beach Park, all found on the western side of the island. These beaches and bays 
                are just some of the many amazing gateways to the fantastic underwater scenery of Maui.

            <p class="text3">Besides coral reefs, Maui is one of the best places in the entire world to swim 
                with beautiful and adorable sea turtles in their natural habitat, especially in Honokeana Bay where turtles are literally everywhere. 
                Swimming with so many turtles on this island was an absolutely surreal experience that 
                anyone should do on their visit to this island paradise.

            <p class="text3">Sea Turtles are also commonly seen on the beaches themselves, especially at the 
                Ho'okipa Beach Park, where hundreds of turtles can be found on the beach at the same time, 
                which was one of the coolest and most fascinating things I've ever seen.
