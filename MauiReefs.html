            <p class="text3">The reefs and beaches of Maui are paradise, with tons to do from relaxing on the beach 
                itself to exploring the underwater world and its incredible marine life off the shores the beautiful island.

            <p class="text3">Snorkeling has to be my favorite thing I did on the island, which my favorite beaches 
                included Honokeana Bay (left), Kapalua Bay (center), Coral Gardens (right) which is only accessible by tour,
                Honolua Bay, and Kahekeli Beach Park, all found on the western side of the island. These beaches and bays 
                are just some of the many amazing places to explore the underwater scenery of Maui, and are certainly not 
                to be missed.

                with beautiful and adorable sea turtles in their natural habitat, especially in Honokeana Bay where turtles are literally everywhere, an absolutely surreal experience that 
                anyone should do on their visit to this island paradise.

                Ho'okipa Beach Park, where hundreds of turtles can be found on the beach at the same time, 
                simply a fascinating sight to behold and one of the coolest things I've ever seen.
