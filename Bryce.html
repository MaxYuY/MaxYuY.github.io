            <p class="text3">Bryce Canyon is one of the best national parks for a day trip in my opinion, as it 
                is rather compact compared to other Utah national parks. However, the scenery is stunning, 
                as this huge natural amphitheater is dotted with sandstone hoodoos that make for a breathtaking visit.

                Inspiration point (Left), Bryce point (center), and Sunrise point (right) bring you some awesome views of the 
                natural amphitheater just meters from the road.

            <p class="text3">On a longer visit, hiking into the canyon is a must. On my visit during early april, I 
                hiked the Queens Garden Trail, which was still quite snowy at the time. Being within the 
                towering hoodoo and desert landscape was surreal and certainly the highlight of my trip to this desert 
                wonderland.
