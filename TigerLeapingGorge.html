            <p class="text3">One of the largest and deepest canyons in the world, Yunnan's Tiger Leaping Gorge 
                is one of the grandest places I've ever been to, a place that makes anyone feel small compare to 
                the grandeur of mother nature and certainly one of the greatest places to enjoy the beauty of 
                this planet.

            <p class="text3">I only had a few hours here in the gorge, and still enjoyed every moment of it. I 
                did the Middle Tiger Leaping Gorge hike, and between the views of the snowy mountains high above us 
                carving into this narrow canyon to the scenes of the rushing Jinsha River up close, even this short hike makes Tiger Leaping 
                Gorge totally worth going out of your way to come here. During the hike, I got to see these adorable squirrels (bottom row), 
                making my Tiger Leaping Gorge experience even more magical.
