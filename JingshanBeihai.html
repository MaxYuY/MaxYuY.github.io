            <p class="text3">Located in the heart of China's capital of Beijing, Jingshan and Beihai parks are 
                historic and scenic gems, perfect for appreciating the gorgeous views and relics of Ancient China 
                and is certainly a must-visit.

            <p class="text3">Jingshan Park is probably one of my favorite scenic spots in Beijing, yielding 
                awesome views of the huge Forbidden City, the home of the Chinese emperors centuries ago. 
                Now, the mountain is accessible by a short hike ascending up the "mountain", a certainly worth it 
                climb due to the gorgeous views I was treated to at the top.

            <p class="text3">Beihai Park is also one of my favorite spots in this bustling city. Serving as the site of 
                several ancient sites like the Nine-Dragon Wall (Top Center) and lots of temples (Top left), not to 
                mention the gorgeous lakeside scenery (Top right), these attractions alone make already make Beihai 
                a splendid place to hang out. However, with the prescence of Beautiful Mandarin Ducks (Bottom two rows), the most 
                beautiful bird in the world my opinion, the park is just simply magical. I spent so much time one morning 
                admiring the beauty of these ducks, with some hanging out right on the shore of the lake, some further out, and 
                some even walking on the frozen part of the lake, which was so adorable to watch up close.
