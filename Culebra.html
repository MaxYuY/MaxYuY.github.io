            <p class="text3"> Isla Culebra located east of Puerto Rico, and is basically an island paradise. 
                The island is incredibly scenic, both above water and underwater and I actually enjoyed my time 
                on this island more than I did in mainland Puerto Rico.

            <p class="text3">Culebra's hilly scenery (Top) is gorgeous. The hotel I stayed in had a great view overlooking 
                the entire island, including the harbor, the small town below, and the nearby island of Vieques off in the distance.
                However, what makes Culebra my favorite place in Puerto Rico is the snorkeling, especially swimming 
                with the adorable sea turtles (bottom) off the shores of Tamarindo Beach, simply a magical experience.
