        <h1 class = "title1">Canyonlands National Park</h1>
        <div class = "container">
            
            <p class="text3">Canyonlands is the largest national park in Utah and one of the most diverse in terms of 
                desert landscapes. The park is located right next to Arches National Park, with plenty of hikes and 
                some of the grandest scenery in all of Utah.
            </p>

            <p class="text3">Canyonlands has tons of crazy canyon views, especially in the Island in the Sky district which I 
                visited. Some notable viewpoints include Shafer Canyon (Left), Green River (center), and Grand View (right) 
                Overlooks, all containing otherworldly desert scenery with snowy mountains in the backdrop. Thus, if you don't 
                have the time to go hiking here in Canyonlands, there is still plenty to see and take in the gorgeous views.

            <p class="text3">The hiking in Canyonlands is extremely impressive, with Mesa Arch (Left and Center) being the 
                most famous. While I didn't get the chance, hiking to the arch during sunrise is by far the 
                best time, but at any time of day, you'll still be able to see the otherworldly desert and canyon 
                scenery through the arch. Another nice hike is the Upheaval Dome trail, taking you to this peculiar 
                landform which may have been formed from a meteorite collision. Hiking here is certainly a must if you have 
                time and want to immerse yourself into Utah's most magnificent canyon scenery.

            <p class="text3">The nearby Dead Horse State Park right next to the Island in the Sky district is 
                probably one of the most impressive state parks in the country, with the Colorado river carving 
                this beautiful canyon with snowy mountains in the backdrop. It's a great short excursion and you 
                to visit alongside Island in the Sky.

            <p class="text3">Canyonlands' otherworldly desert landscape is also home to plenty of wildlife,
                the most common of which being adorable chipmunks, which were found across the park, 
                as well as lizards, seen at Upheaval Dome trail. While the wildlife is certainly not as 
                impressive as that of other parks, Canyonlands is still a bucket-list national park for anyone 
                that enjoys huge canyon and desert views.
