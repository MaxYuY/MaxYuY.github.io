            <p class="text3">Arches National Park is a mecca for its namesake sandstone arches, with over 
                2000 of them in this desert landscape in eastern Utah. The park's hiking is top notch, and 
                with plenty of amazing arches to admire, this park is certainly one of the most iconic
                national parks in the U.S. 
            </p>

            <p class="text3">There are 3 notable sections of Arches, with the first one being the Windows area, containing 4 stunning natural arches. 
                First of which is Turret Arch (Left), which while stunning in itself, provides an awesome sunset view of 
                the two Window Arches (center), which turn from orange to fiery red during dusk. The final arch, Double Arch (Right) can be
                accessible from a different trail than the other two, and consists of 2 separate sandstone bridges, which just looks so cool from below. 
                The Windows section is also the closest of the 3 to the park's entrance, giving you the best introduction 
                to the natural beauty of Arches.

        <div class = "container">
            
            <p class="text3">The Delicate Arch area consists of just one hike, but is certainly the best one in 
                the park. The hike is only a few miles round-trip, and is 100% worth it, especially in sunset where the 
                arch turns to gorgeous red. With the desert scenery all around, Delicate Arch 
                certainly earns the title as one of the most famous attractions of any national park.

        <div class = "container">
            
            <p class="text3">While Delicate Arch is the single most iconic arch in the park, the Devils Garden area 
                is home to the largest collection of these cool sandstone formations. This includes Landscape arch (Top left), 
                one of the longest natural arches in the entire world, Double O Arch (Top center), with 2 sandstone bridges on top of each other, 
                and Partition Arch (Top right), whose higher elevation yields plenty of gorgeous desert views of the Devil's Garden. 
                Aside from the natural arches, the scenery of Devils Garden hike itself is just as stunning, especially paired with the 
                snowy mountains in the backdrop. In addition to wildlife such chipmunks on the trail and even a few Mule Deer (Bottom Right) 
                at the Devils Garden trailhead, all three main sections of this park are equally unique and 
                certainly make Arches one of the coolest natural wonders in the entire United States.
