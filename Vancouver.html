            <p class="text3">Vancouver is one of the biggest cities in Canada and my favorite due to 
                its gorgeous skyline and nature. There is plenty of things to do here and in the city's surroundings, 
                from forest parks to incredible seaside views, easily one of Canada's top destinations. 
            </p>

        <div class = "container">
            
            <p class="text3">Stanley Park is the crown jewel of Vancouver, giving the best views of Vancouver's 
                skyline (left, center), one of the best city skylines in the entire world in my opinion. The 
                totem poles (right) are also a must-see here, representing the indigenous people and cultures that 
                call the region home.

            <p class="text3">Outside the concrete jungle of Vancouver's wonderful skyline, the wildlife of Stanley Park is also abundant, with beautiful Wood Ducks (Top center, top right) and 
                Green Frogs (bottom row) calling the urban forest home.  I also got to see a beaver (top left) in one of the 
                lakes here, a very pleasant surprise that was surreal to see in this city.

            <p class="text3">Another cool spot in the Vancouver vicinity is the Reifel Bird Sanctuary, home to 
                tons of cool bird species, including more gorgeous Wood Ducks (top row), elegant Sandhill 
                Cranes (bottom left), and tons of Mallard Ducks (bottom right). All of these birds were so 
                beautiful to watch from such as close distance, and along with Stanley Park, makes Vancouver 
                a great city to visit for anyone who loves a blend of city-life and nature like I do.
