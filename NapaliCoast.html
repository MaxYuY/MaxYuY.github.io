            <p class="text3">The Napali Coast on the western side of Kauai is only accessible in two ways: 
                By a boat tour and by hiking from the Koke'e State Park. I got to do both, and it's safe to say 
                that the Napali Coast is incredibly beautiful, from land and from the sea, a magical destination that I'll 
                never forget.

            <p class="text3">The boat tour I took to the Napali Coast started from the town of Ele'Ele on the 
                southern part of the island. From the sea, seeing the colorful cliffs of the Napali Coast towering 
                above was surreal, and I got to see a whole pod of dolphins (bottom row) on the way 
                to the magical cliffs, making for a trip I'll never forget.

            <p class="text3">Even if you don't want to spend money on a boat tour, there's plenty of opportunities 
                to view the stunning cliffs from land. The Koke'e State Park is located up the road from Waimea Canyon State Park, 
                consisting of tons of trails to view the incredible Napali Coast. I did the roundtrip 6 mile Awa'Awapuhi Trail (top row), 
                leading to this breathtaking viewpoint of the massive cliff around you overlooking the sea, one of the best hikes I ever did. 
                Even without hiking, there are tons of lookouts of the coast, with the Kalalau and Pu'u O Kila Lookouts (bottom row) being 
                some of the most iconic views of the coast. With tons of opportunities to see this beautiful natural wonder, 
                the Napali Coast has to be one of the greatest spectacles of nature in all of Hawaii.
