            <p class="text3">The Grand Canyon is an icon of the United States and argubly the most famous 
                natural attraction in the country, and it's no wonder why. It's one of the largest canyons in the 
                country, with both rims offering spectacular views. I only had a day-visit at the South Rim, and 
                based on how beautiful the canyon looks from the rim, I have to come back and hike into the 
                canyon one day. However, there is still plenty to see and do from the top of the canyon without
                too much hiking.

            <p class="text3">The viewpoints from the East entrance of the South Rim of the park are absolutely 
                stunning, which includes both Lipan point and Desert View point, which offer some of the greatest 
                and most beautiful and iconic introductory landscape of any U.S. national park, just minutes after 
                you pass the park entrance.

            <p class="text3">Deeper into the South Rim of the park lay some of the most iconic views of the Grand Canyon. 
                Overlooks such as Yavapai, Mather, and Grandview Points are gorgeous and you literally have to visit at least 
                one of these amazing viewpoints of America's greatest natural wonder. With such landscapes, I 
                can only imagine how awesome it would be to hike into the canyon, something that is certainly a 
                surreal experience.
