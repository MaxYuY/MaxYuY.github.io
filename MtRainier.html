            <p class="text3">Mt. Rainier National Park is one of the most popular national parks in the U.S, and 
                with its beautiful landscapes and plentiful wildlife, it is no wonder why. Summer is so gorgeous 
                here, perfect for hiking in the Paradise section of the park and admiring the wildflowers beneath 
                the towering peak as well as the gorgeous surrounding mountains of the Cascades.

            <p class="text3">In Paradise, I hiked the popular Skyline Trail to Panorama Point, which was extremely 
                worth it. The scenery of the trail was surreal, especially seeing the emerald green valleys and Mt. Rainier 
                so close to us. While the clouds did hide away the peak, the views alone makes it one of the coolest 
                trails in any national park.

            <p class="text3">Besides the alpine views of Skyline Trail, there are plenty of waterfalls to admire in the park, 
                including the 57 meter Narada Falls just outside the main Paradise section. The falls itself was stunning 
                and certainly worth the short stop and hike down to the viewpoint.

            <p class="text3">The wildlife of Mt. Rainier is just as great as its scenery. My favorite species 
                has to be the Marmot, which were so abundant along the Skyline Trail and were just so cute and
                adorable to watch up close hanging out within the wildflowers and standing or relaxing near rocky areas.

            <p class="text3">Along with Marmots, I got to see many smaller Ground Squirrels (First 3 columns), which were 
                just as cute and abundant as Marmots across the Skyline Trail. Grouse (Last column) are also common in the park, 
                and I got the pleasure of viewing one in the meadows while hiking Skyline Trail. While the wildlife in Mt. Rainier is 
                not as abundant as some other parks, they are still a gem of the park makes the hiking opportunities and the views 
                a spectacular experience.
