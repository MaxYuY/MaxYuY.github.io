                the city in Sichuan is one of my favorite animals, the Panda. Thus, seeing the Pandas are by 
                far the highlights of the city and makes Chengdu the Panda capital of the world.

                city. This base in downtown Chengdu is home to over 100 adorable pandas (top row), which I witnessed
                playing around and eating, one of the cutest things I've ever seen. The base also 
                houses other animals like Red Pandas (Bottom left, bottom center) as well as majestic Black swans (bottom right) 
                that make the Panda base stand out even more and Chengdu a highlight city in China.
