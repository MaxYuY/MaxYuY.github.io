            <p class="text3">Located in the Ontario Province, Toronto is the beating heart of Canada and one of the
                most beautiful cities in the entire world. Centered around the 553.3 meters tall CN Tower, 
                the city has so many cool things to see and do. Its skyline is one of the most iconic and one of
                the stunning in the world as well, with many skyscrapers rising high up from the shores of Lake 
                Ontario.

            <p class="text3">By far the best place to visit in Toronto and the main place I visited was the city's downtown harbour. The area
                around Toronto Harbour is stunning, as you are surrounded by a sea of skyscrapers towering 
                above. It certainly looks really futuristic from the ground and it's so cool just to take a stroll
                around this beautiful city.

            <div class = "imgtype3"><img src = "images/IMG_3929.JPG" class = "img3" style = "height: 400px; object-position: center 40%;"></div>

            <p class="text3">The wildlife by the Toronto Harbour was amazing! There were countless small ducks
                when we visited as well as a couple beautiful Mute Swans near the piers. The highlight though,
                had to be a sighting of a Red-Tailed Hawk on the pier of the harbour. The hawk had a crow it
                caught earlier in its sharp talons, which was so cool to watch up close. Toronto  
                has the perfect mix of nature and bustling city, certainly a top-tier city to me.
