            <p class="text3">Glacier National Park is Montana's crown jewel, and argubly the most beautiful 
                national park in the entire United States. With its scenic mountains and crystal blue lakes,
                there are so many jaw-dropping landscapes across the park making for a top-notch place
                for natural scenery.

            <p class="text3">Going-to-the-Sun Road is the most famous road in Glacier, and it's no wonder why. 
                With its highest elevation being over 2000 meters above sea level, the road brings you to 
                some of the most pristine alpine scenery in the country. Logan Pass (Top Left), Paradise Meadows (Top Center),
                and Piegan Pass (Top Right) near the St. Mary's Falls are absolute must-stops on this scenic route, bringing some unforgettable
                mountain scenery on your visit. The lakes in the area are stunning too, which includes both Lake Mcdonald (Bottom Left)
                and St. Mary Lake (Bottom Center). Topping it off with beautiful views at the east end of the
                road at the St. Mary's Visitor Center (Bottom Right), this scenic byway is well worth the drive and 
                there is plenty of gorgeous scenery to be found.

            <p class="text3">The other notable part of Glacier National Park is the Many Glacier area, which is
                argubly even more scenic than Going-to-the-Sun Road. Mt. Grinell (Top Left and Top Center) is 
                absolutely stunning, the geological masterpiece of the Many Glacier area. The peak overlooks the
                equally magical Swiftcurrent Lake (Bottom Left and Bottom Center) which can be viewed from the 
                Grinell Glacier Trail, which I unfortunately didn't have time to hike the whole thing. Other
                breathtaking turquoise alpine lakes include Sprague Lake (Top Right) on the Iceberg Lake Trail
                and Lake Sherburne (Bottom Right) along the road into the area. Ultimately, Many Glacier is probably
                my favorite part of Glacier National Park as it is also the best place to find wildlife, as you'll see below, 
                but the alpine scenery here is visually amazing too.

            <p class="text3">While not as diverse as Yellowstone, Glacier National Park's wildlife is still very
                impressive. My favorite animal has to be the grizzly bear, which I had two notable sightings. First of which was
                a mother bear and her 3 cubs (Top Left) just outside the park near Lower St. Mary Lake, which at that point, was
                the most bear cubs I've ever seen in one sighting, and it was so adorable to watch from afar. The 2nd grizzly 
                sighting happened both days I was in Many Glacier, 2 sibling grizzly bears (Top Center) on the mountain high above the Swiftcurrent Inn 
                Hotel, simply a joy to watch though they were extremely far. Plus, on our first day in Many Glacier,
                as I was watching all the Grizzly action, there were also some Mountain Goats (Top Right) high up on the mountain behind, 
                which just added to all the excitement down in the valley. Smaller creatures like Chipmunks (Bottom Left, Bottom Center) were frequently seen along
                both the Many Glacier area and the Going-to-the-Sun Road, and so were Mule Deer (Bottom right), which were particularly 
                abundant along the Iceberg Lake trail to Redrock Falls. With the great variety of wildlife amidst the simply gorgeous alpine landscapes,
                Glacier National Park is certainly worth going out of your way to visit and you certainly won't regret it.
