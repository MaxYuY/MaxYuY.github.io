            <p class="text3">Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, also known as Yulong Snow Mountain, is one of the most 
                awesome adventure destinations not just in China, but in the entire world. Located in the Yunnan 
                Province just north of Lijiang, from the snowy mountain itself and the gorgeous alpine valley below,
                the mountain is one of the crown jewels of the province and certainly 
                one of my favorite destinations in this beautiful country.  
            </p>

            <p class="text3">The Glacier Park in Yulong Snow Mountain is home to some of the highest elevation 
                viewpoints in the entire world! Located between 4500-4680 meters above sea level, Glacier Park is accessible 
                by cable car and is absolutely stunning, bringing you some of the greatest and craziest views I've ever seen of the snowy mountain wall of Mt. Yulong, 
                certainly an unforgettable experience in this winter wonderland.

            <p class="text3">The beautiful Blue Moon Valley right below Jade Dragon Snow Mountain is absolutely 
                breathtaking. Not only do you get crazy good views of the massive mountain, the lakes of Blue 
                Moon Valley have a magical turquoise hue that fits perfectly with the mountain scenery. With the 
                abundance of stunning Common Pochard Ducks (Bottom two rows) with its beautiful plumage, it certainly makes 
                Yulong Snow Mountain and the its surroundings one of the best and most naturally spectacular places I've ever been to in all of China.
