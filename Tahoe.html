            <p class="text3">Located on the California-Nevada border, Lake Tahoe is one of the most famous lakes 
                in the Western United States, with plenty of opportunities for adventure within the breathtaking 
                views of the Sierra Nevada mountains.

            <p class="text3">During winter, skiing at Lake Tahoe is basically a must, with my favorite resort being 
                Heavenly in both Nevada and California, which is by far the most scenic resort I've ever went to. The resort is unique, with views of 
                Lake Tahoe on one side and the barren Nevadan desert on the other, and the sheer contrast between the 
                two vastly different landscape was just awesome to see from Heavenly.

            <p class="text3">Emerald Bay state park on the shores of Lake Tahoe on the California side is absolutely beautiful, with 
                beautiful viewpoints of the bay as well as great hiking such as the Eagle Falls Trail. Seeing 
                the giant lake with snowy mountains in the background is always surreal and this state park is 
                certainly a must-visit when you're in Lake Tahoe.

            <p class="text3">The Nevada side of Lake Tahoe is equally beautiful, with the highlights including 
                Sand Harbor State Park and Memorial Point. Just like Emerald Bay, the crystal blue waters of the lake in front of the
                snowy Sierra Nevada mountains in both places are so cool in my opinion and another stunning destination if you're ever 
                at Lake Tahoe.
