            <p class="text3">La Fortuna is set under the almost symmetrical Arenal Volcano, a simply beautiful 
                rainforest backdrop. It is a hub for both adventure and wildlife, with plenty to do in the are 
                around the small town, another gorgeous place to visit in Costa Rica.

            <p class="text3">I had limited time during my visit here, but one of the best places for adventure 
                has to be the Mistico Arenal Hanging Bridges, a set of suspension bridges that overlooks both the 
                rainforest canopy as well as the stunning Arenal volcano in the backdrop, a really cool and unique 
                attraction that I certainly enjoyed visiting.

            <p class="text3">The wildlife in La Fortuna and its surrounding is just as abundant as the spectacular rainforest 
                scenery. My hotel in La Fortuna offered a sloth tour to the nearby rainforest, which yielded sightings of 
                both 3 toed sloths (top left, top center) and 2-toed sloths (top right), with both species lounging comfortably up in 
                trees. Some birds I got to see on the tour included an owl (bottom left) and many toucans (bottom center), 
                which along with the sloths were amazing to see up close. Even better, I got to see some Coati (bottom right) on the side of the road 
                on the shores of Lake Arenal, a perfect end to my visit to La Fortuna, a magical rainforest and wildlife wonderland here in Costa Rica.
