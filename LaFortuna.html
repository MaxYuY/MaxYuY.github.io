            <p class="text3">La Fortuna is set under the almost symmetrical Arenal Volcano and a beautiful 
                rainforest backdrop. It is a hub for both adventure and wildlife, with plenty to do in the area 
                around the small Costa Rican town.

            <p class="text3">One of the best places for adventure around La Fortuna
                has to be the Mistico Arenal Hanging Bridges, a set of suspension bridges that overlooks both the 
                rainforest canopy as well as the stunning Arenal volcano in the backdrop, making it one of the 
                top attractions to visit in the entire country.

            <p class="text3">The wildlife in La Fortuna and its surrounding is just as abundant as the spectacular rainforest 
                scenery. My hotel in La Fortuna offered a sloth tour to the nearby rainforest, which yielded sightings of 
                both 3 toed sloths (top left, top center) and 2-toed sloths (top right), with both species lounging comfortably up in 
                trees. Some birds I got to see on the tour included an owl (bottom left) and many toucans (bottom center), 
                which along with the sloths were amazing to see up close. Even better, I got to see some Coati (bottom right) on the side of the road 
                when leaving the area, ending off a great visit to this magical rainforest and wildlife wonderland here in Costa Rica.
