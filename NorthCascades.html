            <p class="text3">North Cascades National Park is widely regarded as one of the most underrated 
                national parks in the U.S, being full of scenic alpine views with crystal blue lakes below towering 
                peaks. Thus, the park is a fantastic adventure destination that is sort of out of the beaten path.

            <p class="text3">The hiking opportunities in North Cascades are one of the best in the U.S. I did the Thunder Knob Trail on my visit, 
                leading to views overlooking Diablo Lake, one of the bluest lakes I've ever seen. I also got to see 
                a Grouse (right) on the trail which was really cool too.

            <p class="text3">The viewpoints of North Cascades are just as beautiful, with my favorites being 
                the beaches on the shores of Diablo Lake (left) and the Diablo Lake Viewpoint (middle and right), 
                which is perfect for sunset views of this amazing national park and natural wonder.
