            <p class="text3">Waimea Canyon on the island of Kauai is simply beautiful, and with its colorful scenery and its gorgeous views, 
                it's no wonder why it's called the Grand Canyon of the Pacific and one of the best places to visit on the 
                entire island and all of Hawaii. 
            </p>

            <p class="text3">The most popular and my favorite thing I did at Waimea Canyon was just simply admiring the 
                canyon from the overlooks. Viewpoints like the main Waimea Canyon and Pu'u Ka Pele Lookouts bring 
                stunning views of the canyon as well as the Waipo'o Falls in the distance: simply magical.

            <p class="text3">Besides the views of the gorgeous canyon, the other cool place at the Waimea Canyon 
                State Park is the Red Dirt Waterfall area, which looks otherworldly up close, especially during 
                the evening hours when the landscape turns into a fiery red, making the canyon scenery in this park even 
                more magical to look at and admire.
