            <p class="text3">While not as much as Maui, The reefs and beaches of Kauai are still so biodiverse,
                 with tons of cool coral reefs and marine wildlife to be found, both on the beach and underwater, 
                 making the island paradise really cool in my opinion.

                some of my favorite snorkeling spots on Kauai, featuring a really cool array of marine life and coral 
                reefs that I was really impressed with.

            <p class="text3">Such marine life included tons of beautiful Sea turtles (top left, top center, bottom left, bottom center), by far my favorite marine animal 
                to swim with and one of the coolest creatures found on this planet, as well as a striking 
                Eagle Ray, which seemed like a juvenile ray due to its small size. Both the Ray and the 
                large amount of sea turtles I found at Koloa Landing Bay, making the place my favorite snorkeling spot 
                in Kauai and one of my favorite in Hawaii.

            <p class="text3">At Poipu Beach, I got to see a ton of marine life on the beach itself. This included 
                the famous daily turtle arrival (top left) on the beach in the evening, so special to witness every night 
                here. These turtles make their way back to sea at dawn, which I also got to catch one beautiful turtle (top center, top right)
                leaving the beach pretty late into the morning. Besides turtles, Poipu beach is the common spot to 
                see rare Hawaiian Monk Seals (bottom row), which I found a few resting on the beach and on the island 
                across from Poipu, both really cool and adorable to witness in person. Overall, Kauai's beaches and 
                reefs and the variety of marine life found there are so cool, making the island itself a top tier 
                destination to travel to.
