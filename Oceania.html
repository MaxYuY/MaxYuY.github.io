            <p class="text1">Oceania and the Pacific Islands are literally paradise, full of stunning beach
                getaways and otherworldly landscapes. The volcanoes of <a href = "Haleakala.html">Haleakala</a>
                National Park in Maui and the colorful <a href = "WaimeaCanyon.html">Waimea Canyon</a> are just a

                admire the gorgeous and vast underwater world. While I haven't been to anywhere outside of 
                Hawaii in Oceania, with so much to do in Hawaii, you can imagine the plethora of great sights
                and places to visit across this breathtaking and diverse region and I'll certainly go back
                to explore more.
