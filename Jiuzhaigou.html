            <p class="text3">Jiuzhaigou Valley National Park in northern Sichuan province is one of China's most 
                beautiful destinations, and it's no wonder why. Within its valleys are some of the most 
                blue and crystal clear lakes, some of the best mountain views, and some of the country's most 
                stunning waterfalls. With so much to see, the park is one of my favorite places I've ever 
                been to in China and certainly one of the most naturally beautiful.

            <p class="text3">Jiuzhaigou contains 3 main valleys: Zechawa, Rize, and Shuzheng. Zechawa Valley is the 
                highest elevation valley in the park, consisting of Jiuzhaigou's largest and highest alpine lake, 
                Long Lake (Left), at over 3100m above sea level, as well as the smallest and one of the most vibrant 
                lakes, the 5-Colored Lake (Right), with stunning hues of blue that's literally heaven on Earth. In general, 
                when I visited, it was pretty cloudy and misty, but all the lakes, especially 5-Colored Lake, retain 
                their magical blue hue that's so appealing to me.

            <p class="text3">The Rize Valley contains the largest collection of alpine lakes in Jiuzhaigou. 
                Every one of them was absolutely stunning, but especially the deep blue Panda Lake (Left), 
                the crystal clear Mirror Lake (center), and the gorgeous views of Arrow Bamboo Lake (Right). 
                Rize Valley has so many other great attractions and so many more crystal blue lakes, 
                argubly the best part of the park so some visitors.

            <p class="text3">The Shuzheng Valley is the closest valley to the entrance, and is also argubly 
                the most stunning. This valley is my personal favorite, consisting of the magically famous Nuorilang Falls (Top left, top center)
                known as the widest and one of the largest natural waterfalls in China. The valley also consists of some 
                awesome valley and mountain views above the park's waters, with Tiger Lake (Top right) and the 
                Shuzheng Lakes (Bottom row) being my favorite areas. Specifically, the Shuzheng Lakes was the only 
                major hike I got to do here, yielding some spectacular views of the mountains above the valley as 
                well as hidden lakes and waterfalls. Overall, Jiuzhaigou's 3 valleys couldn't be more different,
                when it comes to the set of alpine scenery, but 
                all combined make it a top-notch national park and scenic spot to visit.
